A stylized shield icon with a digital lock in the center, surrounded by subtle cryptocurrency symbols (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin) arranged in a circular pattern. The shield is rendered in a gradient from deep blue to teal, conveying security and modern technology. The lock is a minimalist white design with a keyhole, placed centrally. The background is a light gray gradient to provide contrast. The overall composition is clean, professional, and communicates trust and multi‑currency support.
